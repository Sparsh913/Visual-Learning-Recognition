# hw1

We strongly suggest using conda (or miniconda) for package management. We wrote this assignment using a conda environment with python 3.7, but using a later version should work too.

For this assignment, please install PyTorch (`torch`, `torchaudio`, and `torchvision`) for your system, following the instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

You will also need to install `matplotlib` and `tensorboard`. For any other package dependencies, use conda to install them as they come up as needed for your individual system.

We also provide a `requirements.txt` file which mirrors our conda environment and can be installed to a new conda environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If the requirements.txt gives an error, you can follow the following instructions which ensure the exact versions.

```
virtualenv -p python vlra1
source vlra1/bin/activate
pip install numpy==1.21.5
pip install tensorboard==2.11.2
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install six==1.16.0
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2
pip install imageio==2.33.1
pip install matplotlib==3.4.1 opencv-python wget
```
